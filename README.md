incerr is a tiny lightweight library wrapping (parts of) functionality from [<system_error>](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error.html#System_error) in (in the author's opinion) saner way for 2025 so one could use [std::error_code](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/error_code.html) inside [std::expected](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/expected/) as the 'unexpected' type in a more straightforward manner.
